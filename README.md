# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz
This is about creating a quiz
I have created a code for the Web-ApI where the user will be able to stat the quiz using the start button.There is a timer attached with the code as well. As soon as he/she chooses the correct option, the next question will appear and the quiz will move on. However, if a wrong answer is chosen, the player will be penalised be deducting some time.
